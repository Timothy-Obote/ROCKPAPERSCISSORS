I created a simple rockpaperscissor game which helped me practice javascript knowledge where the end user picks between the three making 
,the computer randomly picks form the three choices as a reponse to the end user .Buttons had to be responsove in that case 
i added math random function which randomly picks a number from 0 - 1 divided the ranges to three added if statement for both the computer move and the result
finally used an alert statement to display the results
